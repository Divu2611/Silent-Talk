# Silent Talk

### A real time application that convert American Sign Language to text. <br/>
The model was trained using the VGG-16 network, which then forecasts the desired outcome.  <br/>
Data was gathered from [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet). <br/>
The interactive user interface was then implemented using Tkinter and OpenCV.  <br/>

To increase the accuracy, several models were trained. <br/>
(All characters may be predicted by the main model, but a different and unique model was also trained for each group, such as "GHU," "JY," "LTX," and "BMN," because these certain groups of characters had similar signs).

## Installation
To run the code a basic IDE (like VS Code) is required. <br/>
Tools and python libraries required to run the project: <br/>
* Tensorflow 2
* Tkinter
* OpenCV <br/>
